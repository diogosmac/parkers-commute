It isn't stored anywhere except for your browser, and I don't have access to it. <br><br> However, if you do not feel comfortable with using your real places, feel free to use other places that you know, as the game will still work! <br><br> You can input the name of the place, rather than the address, as if you were searching on Google Maps! </p> </div> <div id="center-form" class="form-wrap"> <div class="form"> <p class="tag">Home Address:</p><input type="text" id="home-input"> <p class="description"> Where you live. The street name will do, but the number will help the game feel more immersive (particularly if you live on a large street). <br><br> </p> <p class="tag">Work Address:</p><input type="text" id="work-input"> <p class="description"> Where you work (or study). If you don't know the address, the name of the place is fine! <br><br> </p> <p class="tag">Market Address:</p><input type="text" id="market-input"> <p class="description"> Where you shop for groceries. For most people this will be a supermarket, but it could be something else too! <br> (You can type, for example, "Lidl Areosa", and your supermarket will be found). <br><br> </p> <p class="tag">Gym Address:</p><input type="text" id="gym-input"> <p class="description"> Where you exercise. Ok, this one might not apply to everyone. If you don't have a suitable location for this, feel free to replace it with a place where you do any other activity! <br><br> </p> <p class="description-big"> The data will update as you type, you don't have to submit anything. You can also come back and change the data whenever you want - you'll just need to restart your game! </p> </div> </div> <div id="post"> <p> When you're ready, <a href="game.html">click here</a> to start playing! </p> </div> </body></html>
